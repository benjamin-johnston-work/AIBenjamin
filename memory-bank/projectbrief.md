# Project Brief

## Project Overview
Intelligent Adaptive Brick Ball Game - A visual Breakout/Arkanoid game with AI that analyzes player performance and subtly adjusts difficulty to help struggling players and challenge skilled ones.

## Core Requirements
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS (no external dependencies)
- 800x600 canvas with smooth paddle/ball physics
- 6 rows of colorful bricks with different hit points and scores
- 3 lives system with game over/restart functionality
- Power-up system (Wide Paddle, Multi-ball, etc.)
- AI performance tracking and adaptive assistance
- Level progression system

## Project Scope
**Included:**
- Complete brick ball game mechanics
- Rule-based AI performance analysis
- Subtle physics adjustments for struggling players
- Smart power-up timing
- Visual effects and polish

**Excluded:**
- External APIs or machine learning
- Backend servers or databases
- npm packages or build tools
- localStorage (all state in JS variables)

## Success Criteria
- Smooth 60fps gameplay with responsive controls
- AI assistance that's helpful but not obvious
- Complete game progression through multiple levels
- Works offline by opening HTML file in browser
- Balanced difficulty that adapts to player skill

## Key Constraints
- Single HTML file only (no separate JS/CSS files)
- No external libraries beyond basic HTML/CSS/JS
- Must work completely offline
- No build tools or compilation required
- All AI behavior coded manually using performance metrics

## Stakeholders
- Primary User: Player seeking engaging brick ball experience
- Developer: Creating adaptive game mechanics
