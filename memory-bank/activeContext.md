## Active Decisions and Considerations
**Major Architectural Decisions Completed:**
- ✅ **Multi-file structure** chosen over single-file constraint for maintainability
- ✅ **ES6 modules** selected for clean dependency management
- ✅ **Component-based entities** implemented for flexibility and reusability
- ✅ **Event-driven communication** established for system decoupling
- ✅ **Centralized configuration** created for easy parameter tuning
- ✅ **Modern development practices** adopted (debug mode, error handling, documentation)

**New Architectural Patterns:**
- ✅ **Separation of concerns** - Each module has single responsibility
- ✅ **Dependency injection** - Systems receive dependencies rather than creating them
- ✅ **Observer pattern** - Event-driven communication between systems
- ✅ **Factory pattern** - Entity creation through static factory methods
- ✅ **Strategy pattern** - Different AI assistance strategies based on performance

## Important Patterns and Preferences
**Established Successful Patterns:**
- **Modular development** - Clean separation enables independent feature development
- **Event-driven architecture** - Decoupled systems communicate through well-defined events
- **Entity-component system** - Flexible entity composition with reusable components
- **Configuration-driven design** - Game behavior controlled through centralized parameters
- **Performance-first approach** - All systems optimized for 60fps target
- **Defensive programming** - Robust error handling and bounds checking throughout

**New Development Patterns:**
- **Module-first design** - New features start as independent modules
- **Test-driven development** - Debug mode enables real-time system verification
- **Documentation-driven development** - Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- **Progressive enhancement** - Features can be added without modifying existing code
- **Performance monitoring** - Built-in debug tools for performance analysis
