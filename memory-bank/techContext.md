# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
**Core Technologies:**
- **HTML5** - Document structure and Canvas element
- **CSS3** - Styling, layout, and visual effects
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Game logic, physics, AI, and interactivity
- **Canvas 2D API** - Graphics rendering and animation
- **Web APIs** - requestAnimationFrame, event handling, DOM manipulation

**No External Libraries** - Pure vanilla implementation as per constraints

## Development Setup
**Minimal Requirements:**
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Text editor or IDE for development
- No build tools, compilers, or package managers required
- No server setup needed - runs directly from file system

**Development Workflow:**
1. Edit single HTML file
2. Save changes
3. Refresh browser to test
4. No compilation or build step required

## Technical Constraints
**Strict Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Single HTML file only (no separate JS/CSS files)
- ✅ No external APIs or services
- ✅ No npm packages or external libraries
- ✅ No backend servers or databases
- ✅ Must work completely offline
- ✅ No localStorage (all state in JavaScript variables)
- ✅ No build tools or compilation steps
- ✅ Testable by simply opening HTML file in browser

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Modern browsers with Canvas 2D support
- ES6+ JavaScript features used
- No experimental or cutting-edge APIs

## Dependencies
**Zero External Dependencies:**
- No CDN links
- No external JavaScript libraries
- No external CSS frameworks
- No web fonts or external assets
- No API calls or network requests
- Completely self-contained

## Tool Usage Patterns
**Development Tools:**
- Text editor for code editing
- Web browser for testing
- Browser developer tools for debugging
- No build pipeline or task runners

**Testing Approach:**
- Manual testing in browser
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance monitoring via browser dev tools
- No automated testing framework (not required for scope)

## Environment Configuration
**Single Environment:**
- No separate development/staging/production environments
- File runs identically everywhere
- No environment variables or configuration files
- No deployment process - just copy HTML file

**Browser Environment:**
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Canvas 2D API support required
- Modern browser with ES6+ support
- No special browser settings needed

## Integration Points
**None by Design:**
- No external APIs
- No third-party services
- No database connections
- No server-side components
- Completely isolated system

## Technical Debt
**None Identified:**
- Clean, well-structured code
- Follows established patterns
- No known performance issues
- No security vulnerabilities
- No compatibility problems
- Code is maintainable and extensible

**Future Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Could add sound effects (within constraints)
- Could add more power-up types
- Could implement additional AI assistance strategies
- Could add visual themes or customization
